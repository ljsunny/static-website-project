            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather
                than as a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have
                attractive/cute appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on
                an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these
                characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Pets</h2>
            <h3>Dog</h3>
            <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also
                called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf; the gray wolf is the dog's
                closest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate
                that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, which was before the development of
                agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic
                individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
                canids.[4]

                The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and
                physical attributes.[5] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for
                humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military,
                companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to
                human behavior, and the humanâ€“canine bond has been a topic of frequent study. This influence on human
                society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".</p>
            <h3>Cat</h3>
            <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated
                carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Recent advances in
                archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around
                7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding
                human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable
                claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick
                reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social
                species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like
                meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear
                sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It
                secretes and perceives pheromones.</p>
            <h3>Hamster</h3>
            <p>Hamsters are rodents (order Rodentia) belonging to the subfamily Cricetinae, which contains 19 species
                classified in seven genera.[1][2] They have become established as popular small pets.[3] The best-known
                species of hamster is the golden or Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), which is the type most
                commonly kept as a pet. Other hamster species commonly kept as pets are the three species of dwarf
                hamster, Campbell's dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli), the winter white dwarf hamster (Phodopus
                sungorus) and the Roborovski hamster (Phodopus roborovskii).

                Hamsters are more crepuscular than nocturnal and, in the wild, remain underground during the day to
                avoid being caught by predators. They feed primarily on seeds, fruits, and vegetation, and will
                occasionally eat burrowing insects.[4] Physically, they are stout-bodied with distinguishing features
                that include elongated cheek pouches extending to their shoulders, which they use to carry food back to
                their burrows, as well as a short tail and fur-covered feet.</p>
